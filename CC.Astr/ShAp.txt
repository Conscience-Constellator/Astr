On the subject of donuts:
	Belts cross-section is A digon.
	Mobius strip are belts that've been, cut at A point, & reattached after being twisted .5 rotations around.
		This has the effect that if the sides of A belt where, red, & blue,
			at the seam of reattachment, the colors would lead into each other,
			such that if 1 "walked" along it, unable to cross edges,
			they'd pass seams between colors 2ic to return to starting point.
	Mobius strip:
		It's strip's cross-section is A digon. It's period is 2.
		Twists .5 each round.
	Identifying rules that give it it's desirable qualities:
		Quality: It twists some multiple of it's cross section's rotational period.
		Effect: Transitions between sides are smooth.
		Other 2D shapes can be used, w/ rotation that plays nice w/ it.
	Triangle can only be rotated multiple of 1/3. It's period is 3.
	Octagon can be rotated,
		1/8: 1 track, period 8,
		1/4: 2 track, period 4,
		3/8: 1 track, period 8.
	Nonagon:
		1/9: 1 track, period 9,
		1/3: 3 track, period 3,
		2/9: 1 track, period 9,
		4/9: 1 track, period 9.
	Shapes w/ even numbers can have versions that alternate between, convex, & concave, corners,
		that twist multiples of 2 sides.
		An example is decagon's version; 5 pointed star.
	Extending this,
		any structure that the number of sides in A shape is divisible by,
		can be repeated around the shape, such as, instead of A 2 side spike(like 5-point star),
		A trapezoidal bump, which has 3 sides, like A 2-side spike w/ tip cut off, making 3rd side.
